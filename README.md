### Brief about the project
This project will visualize the FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms in real time and keep track of Hits, Faults and Hit Ratio.
4 Frames are provided for the visualizaton.
The Algorithm switch button will toggle between FIFO and LRU algorithms and reset the setup.
Each "paint button" adds a color which represents a page onto the frames. (Colors are used here instead of numbers in order to provide a visual treat)
The Redo button resets the setup without changing the algorithm.
